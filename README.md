# AbeBooker
A python script that pulls ISBN's from the 3rd column of an XLSX document named "books.xlsx" and gives an estimate of the value of the collection based on the first price shown on Abebooks. There's definitely room for improvement here and I tried to include some notes but this project still needs some polish.
